          If you choose to be a buddy, it is important to have thorough
          knowledge of your neighborhood and its quirks and features. It is also
          advantageous if you have already had experience with the asylum
          process or are a former refugee yourself. As a buddy you will be a
          mentor and share your past experiences. You have the ability to take
          the time to help refugees with your advice and action. Intercultural
          communication is your passion, and you have an affinity for languages.

          It is not necessary that you are already an expert at everything. Much
          more important is your willingness to help refugees to find their way
          in a new environment. You have been living here and have a great deal
          of regional experience, which the refugees can benefit from the most.

          Don't get overwhelmed. There are extremely many issues refugees are
          facing. Still, you can be proactive and signal that you're there and
          standing by for help with some of the issues. Stay positive and
          support in this way. Patience is also required, change often takes
          time. Try to understand the refugeeâ€™s personality and adapt your
          communication style accordingly.

          A buddy provides moral support in the first important weeks by
          introducing the new living environment. Relationships matter. A buddy
          may be the first point of contact for refugees and should be capable
          of establishing help quickly. You want people to feel comfortable and
          safe asking questions and bringing up issues. We live the culture of
          openness and teamwork.
